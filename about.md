BuckeyeLAN is a student-run organization at The Ohio State University that hosts video game events and tournaments. We hold themed monthly events and one large event with several tournaments each semester.

We play and hold tournaments for a wide variety of games: from MOBAs like League of Legends and DotA, to Nintendo games like Mario Kart and Smash. Fighting Games such as UMvC3 and Ultra Street Fighter 4, RTSs like StarCraft II, HearthStone, console shooters, we have it all!
